## React - Interaction & State Management

1. Create an `AddPlace` form with 3 fields: `name`, `phone`, `email` and a submit button. Place the form below the list of places.
2. Move the places data into the state of the App and setup the AddPlace form to create a new entry.
3. Make sure the name is a required field and the form is reset everytime you click submit.

_Hint_ This is tedious work, and for real world use-cases eventually you want to use form library like Formik or final-form.

4. Bonus Exercise: Convert the form to Formik.
