## React - Styling

1. Refactor the Card styling to use CSS modules.
2. Improve the list layout to on the left side show the banner image of the location. If no image is available show the map. On the right side the details like name, phone, email and so on. See the screenshot in this directory for an example.

**Hint**: You can change the Map component to accept a className prop and apply it to the `div`. This way you can use the same className for the image and the map.
